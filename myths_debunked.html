					Facts
				</h1>
				
				<h3 class="fact">
					The United States does not have an official language; 31 states do specify English as their official language, but not the country as a whole.
				</h3>
				
				<h3 class="fact">
					The available evidence suggests the opposite of this to be true; People educated in multiple languages tend to be better at using English than monolingual speakers are
				</h3>
				
				<h3 class="fact">
					This is not supported by any evidence; English exists and thrives in many multilingual countries, with no sign of that changing soon
				</h3>
				
				<h3 class="fact">
					English Only policies would only have effect in government settings, where English is already the primary (and often only) language used; it would have no (legal) effect on language use in other scenarios
				</h3>
				
				<h3 class="fact">
					English Only policies would only 'unify' government settings, by excluding speakers of other languages; they would have a negative effect on unification, if any, outside of government settings
				</h3>
				
				<h3 class="fact">
					Spanish has been spoken in the United States for at least as long as English
