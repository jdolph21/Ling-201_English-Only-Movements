            <p class="spanish_info">
                      Almost a century before the first English settlers came to the New World and founded Jamestown, Spanish explorers
                  had already expanded north from their colonies in South and Central America and begun founding colonies in current
                  United States territory. From the Atlantic Florida coast to the northern California shores, the Spanish colonists and
                  language have shaped much of the southern United States to this day.

              <ul class="spanish_list">
                <li class="spanish_bullet">
                      Beginning in 1513, Spanish conquistadores began exploring the Florida peninsula, and by 1565, they established
                  the oldest surviving settlement in the United States, known as San Augustín (St. Augustine today). From this base in
                  Florida, the Spanish explored up the Atlantic coast, including into Georgia, the Carolinas, Virginia, and even new
                  England, but their efforts to establish a permanent colony farther north never succeeded.
                </li>
                <li class="spanish_bullet">
                      Upon the failure of their colonial ambitions in eastern North America, the focus of the Spanish Empire shifted
                  towards the vast expanses of the modern western United States. Under leaders such as Francisco Coronado and Juan de
                  Oñate, all or portions of the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, and Texas were explored
                  extensively. Santa Fe, the second-oldest city in the United States, was founded in New Mexico in 1605, preceding
                  Jamestown in Virginia under the English by two years, and as many as one hundred thousand Spanish speakers lived in
                  the above states by the mid-19th century. Spain even bought the Louisiana territory from France in 1763, and held it
                  briefly before selling it back.
                </li>
                <li class="spanish_bullet">
                      Before Spain's empire disintegrated in the Americas, a large influx of English speakers, particularly to Texas,
                  was beginning to occur. Upon independence in 1821, Mexico began offering United States citizens money to farm cattle
                  in what was their land then and now modern Texas. Eventually, Texas fought Mexico and became an independent country
                  in 1836, then joined the United States ten years later in 1845. An enraged Mexico declared war on the United States,
                  which they then lost, and was forced to cede all of the modern Southwest to the United States.
                </li>
                <li class="spanish_bullet">
                      Even upon annexation, much of the population of the United States southwest spoke Spanish, and has continued to
                  do so to this day. Through isolation from Mexico and the rest of Latin America, along with being driven into contact
                  with English, various Spanish dialects such as Arizonan, New Mexican, Texan, and Native American language influenced
                  Spanish have emerged alongside Mexican and Castillian Spanish. In addition, the Spanish diaspora has resulted in 
                  the growth of Cuban, Puerto Rican, and Dominican Spanish in places such as Miami and New York in recent times.
                  Ultimately, Spanish and English have co-existed in the United States for nearly two centuries, resulting in numerous
                  dialectal and cultural effects lasting to this day in nearly every part of the country.

            <p class="french_info">
                  French influence in North America, despite beginning in Canada, eventually covered a swath of the continental
              United States from Northern Vermont to Western Montana and the North Dakotan border with Canada down to southern
              Louisiana. Even by the end of French ownership of North American territory with the Louisiana Purchase by the
              United States, French impact on the regions it controlled is still visible today, in architecture, culture,
              language, and a multitude of place names.
              <ul class="french_list">
                <li class="french_bullet">
                      French Louisiana and the Midwest were explored primarily by fur traders, missionaries and soldiers seeking a
                      passage to Asia through the North American interior. Even though this was never found, settlements and towns
                      were set up all throughout the claimed territory. These were almost exclusively located on rivers for easy
                      trade, and furs were their commercial lifelines, all of which were sent out through the Gulf of St. Lawrence in
                      Canada and the Mississippi River in Louisiana.
                </li>
                <li class="french_bullet">
                      Louisiana quickly became of vital importance to the French, as it was the point through which almost all inland
                      commercial goods left through for Europe. When founded in 1699, New Orleans was built up quickly, and many of
                      the original streets can be found in its French Quarter today. Upon the end of the French and Indian War, many
                      Acadians fled what is now Nova Scotia when it was sacked by the British and relocated to southern Louisiana and 
                      New Orleans, resulting in an incredibly diverse state populated by French settlers, Creoles (African Americans
                      who inhabit New Orleans), Cajuns (French-Canadians from Acadia that live in southern Louisiana), and African
                      Americans.
                </li>
                <li class="french_bullet">
                      The French colonial legacy is evident in multiple areas of United States geography and society to this day. 
                  Cities from Idaho to Maine bear French names, such as Detroit, Michigan (means "strait"), Terre Haute, Indiana 
                  (means "high ground"), Boise, Idaho (means "wooded"), and Baton Rouge, Louisiana (means "red stick"). Fifteen states
                  have names either from French itself or are French renditions of Native American names for the region. Examples of
                  these states are Iowa, Vermont, Illinois, Mississippi and Wisconsin. According to Athabasca University, a Canadian
                  University, approximately 45% of English words stem from French in some manner, so French impacts the way English is
                  spoken constantly. French is also the language spoken at home of over 1.3 million United States citizens, ranging
                  from the Acadians of Maine and Louisiana to native speakers from France, Haiti, Senegal, Côte d'Ivoire, and other 
                  African countries.

            <p class="dutch_info">
              Dutch colonization in North America was very localized, being located primarily around New York city, but extending north
              to Albany, as well as encompassing parts of Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Connecticut. Its founding
              was during the Dutch Golden Age, a period during which the Dutch East India Company, under Henry Hudson, for whom the
              Hudson river is named, explored the area comprising the colony. Despite only lasting a little more than fifty years, its
              impact on United States language, culture and architecture has persisted to the modern day.
              <ul class="dutch_list">
                <li class="dutch_bullet">
                      New Netherland brought in wealth to the Dutch East India Company until 1664, when Peter Stuyvesant, conqueror of
                      New Sweden a decade before and the last Director-General of the colony, surrendered it to the British under the
                      threat of four frigates. Despite subjugation by the British, the Dutch were stubborn and kept their language. It
                      continued to be spoken in New Jersey, New York City, Albany, Dutchess, Schennectady and Ulser county for a long
                      time. Dutch remained the majority language in New York City until 1730, and in regions farther out it was spoken
                      for much longer.
                </li>
                <li class="dutch_bullet">
                      In the Hudson Valley and Albany, Dutch remained strong for a long time. Multiple Dutch visitors commented on the
                      use of the language, such as Richard Smith and Patrick M'Robert. Church services and written records were taken
                      in Dutch, and Sojourner Truth, a famous African American abolitionist, was born in New York and grew up speaking
                      Dutch as her first language. Martin van Buren, the eighth president of the United States, was born in the Dutch
                      town of Kinderhook and spoke Dutch as well. It is estimated that the last native speaker of Jersey Dutch, John C.
                      Storms, died in 1949, and his brother, who wasn't entirely fluent, died in 1962.
                </li>
                <li class="dutch_bullet">
                      Even though Dutch ultimately died out in the United States, its impact on the English language, place names, and
                      architecture is abundant. Many words in use today come from Dutch. Some examples of these are waffles (from
                      "wafels"), sketch (from "schets"), landscape (from "landschap"), coleslaw (from "koolsla"), and cookie (from 
                      "koekie"), among many others. The term "Yankee" comes from the Dutch nickname "Jan Kees", given to Dutch cheese
                      producers, and the famous New York basketball team, the Knicks, got their name from the Dutch last name
                      "Knickerbocker". Most famously, many parts of New York city have names derived from their Dutch counterparts.
                      these include Brooklyn (derived from "Breukelen"), the Bronx (named after a farmer named Jonas Bronck, who owned
                      a farm there), Harlem (from "Haarlem"), and the Bowery (from "Bouwerij", a farm owned by Peter Stuyvesant). Dutch
                      architecture, as pictured on the left in New York City, survives to this day, and is a blend of Baroque, Gothic,
                      and renaissance styles.

            <p class="swedish_info">
                  The colony of New Sweden, despite being one of the least well-known about, least populated, and 
              shortest-lived, still left an impact on the United States as a whole. Beginning in 1637, and lasting only until
              1655, it, along with over a million future Swedish immigrants, brought their language, culture, and traditions 
              to the United States, where many of the effects can still be seen today.

              <ul class="swedish_list">
                <li class="swedish_bullet">
                      New Sweden, the last of the major European colonies in the New World, was founded near modern-day Wilmington, 
                  Delaware, and it ruled over parts of modern Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey. Sweden's main goal was to 
                  establish its own colonial empire abroad, as it was a great European power at the time, and this brought it
                  into conflict with the other European powers of the New World, despite generally coexisting peacefully with the
                  Native American tribes it came into contact with.
                </li>
                <li class="swedish_bullet">
                      The downfall of New Sweden was largely caused due to poor relations with the Dutch in New Netherland, who 
                  threatened "mishaps, bloodsheds and disturbances" if the Swedes continued colonizing the land near them. In 
                  1653, the new governor of New Sweden, despite being given clear orders to avoid "danger and hostility" with 
                  the Dutch, decided to sack the Dutch Fort Casimir. This resulted in the Dutch, under Peter Stuyvesant,
                  director-general of New Netherland, destroying New Sweden, never to be rebuilt. Despite this, Swedish continued
                  to be spoken in the region almost until the American Revolution.
                </li>
                <li class="swedish_bullet">
                      Despite only existing as an independent entity for seventeen years, New Sweden introduced several notable
                  elements of US society and culture. Swedish colonists were known for their building of log cabins, which is a
                  very well-known style of house. The image to the right is of the Lower Swedish Cabin, built by Swedish settlers
                  and is the oldest log cabin in the United States. Swedish colonists also introduced Lutheran Christianity, a
                  branch of Protestantism, to the United States, which is prevalent in the Upper Midwest.
                </li>
                <li class="swedish_bullet">
                      In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, following a doubling of the Swedish population and a massive
                  famine in Sweden, more than 1.3 million Swedes left Sweden for the United States, moving largely to the
                  Midwest region, partly due to the lake-ridden scenery resembling their homeland. Upon settling, they became 
                  farmers, miners, and railroad workers, also settling in cities like Chicago, where they worked in urban 
                  professions, where they spoke, read, and wrote in Swedish for a period of time. Today millions of US citizens are 
                  of Swedish ancestry, and Swedish settlers are also to thank for the founding of Augustana College.
