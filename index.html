          <p class="mission">In the United States today, there is a belief among some that English is the official language of the country and that it
            alone should be used in all communication. Due to this and other similar beliefs, at times there arise situations where 
            those who hold to this ideology try to force or shame others into exclusively using English vs. their native language, 
            including those who don't know or haven't achieved fluency in it. Our mission with this website is to debunk as many English
            Only myths as possible, explaining them from a linguistic perspective and introducing facts about linguistic and cultural
            diversity within the United States to undermine the credibility of these myths.

          <p class="myths_explanation">
            These images serve as examples of how language myths are perpetuated in society at large. It can be a flyer from a Dunkin'
            Donuts offering free food and drinks for correcting co-workers who aren't speaking English. It can be the former owner of
            Geno's subs in Philadelphia essentially saying that speaking a language other than English, since English is the official
            language, is worthy of deportation. It can take any form, but the message is usually based on a misunderstanding of United
            States language policy, which in fact doesn't prescribe an official language, and even if it did, it wouldn't result in an
            English requirement for every area of life. The above arguments illustrate the necessity for a deeper understanding of
            language use and requirements, or the lack thereof, within the United States. Until that occurs, examples such as these
            will continue to occur.
